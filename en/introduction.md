About Craft CMS
===============

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It does so by offering developers a high level of flexibility, both in terms of content modeling and the front-end views, while also giving content managers a remarkably intuitive authoring experience.

## What it’s For

Craft is made for bespoke websites and mobile applications, where strong control over branding and content types are a priority. It is optimized for creating experiences from scratch, rather than modifying existing themes.

## General Tech Specs

Craft is a self-hosted PHP application built on [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/), but you don’t need to know PHP or Yii to use it unless you intend to write your own plugins. For more information on the technical requirements of Craft, [see the Requirements section](requirements.md).
