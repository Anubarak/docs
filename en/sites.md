Sites
======================

Sites allows you to host multiple sites in a single Craft installation. You can define one or more sites at different domains, using a different set of templates, and different versions of entry content.

The multi-site feature in Craft is designed for sites with similar content structures. You manage the multi-site content at the entry level, with the ability to the enable Sections you want included in a site.

## Creating a Site

When you install Craft you automatically get a default site. The site name is what you defined at time of installation, and the handle is `default`.

You add additional sites using the Sites settings in Settings -> Sites.

A site has the following attributes:

* Group
* Name
* Handle
* Language
* Is Primary Site?
* Base URL


### Site Groups

Site Groups allow you to organize your sites together by commonality, like language or site type.

Craft creates the first Site Group for you--named after the default site--and assigns the default site to that group.

Similar to [Field Groups](), Site Groups are for organization only.

### Language

Choosing the language for the site tells Craft the language to use when generating date and time formatting and system messages.

In your templates, you can also access the language setting via `craft.app.language`. You can use this in a conditional:

```
{% if craft.app.language == 'de' %}
    <p>Guten Tag!</p>
{% endif %}
```

Or as a way to automatically include the proper template for each language:

```
{% include '_share/footer-' ~ craft.app.language %}
```

where your template name would be, for example, `_share/footer-de`. 


### Primary Site

Craft sets the default site as the Primary site, meaning Craft will load it by default on the front end. If you only have one site then you cannot disable it as the Primary site. 

You can change the Primary site once you create additional sites using the settings for the new site. Craft will automatically toggle the current Primary site.

### Site URL

Any additional site can have its own Base URL apart from the URL you defined when creating the first site.

This comes in handy for hosting the site at a different domain instead of in a subdirectory. Instead of using `https://craftcms.com/de`, you can have a different domain like `https://de.craftcms.com` or `https://craftcms.de`.

Defining a Base URL for your site requires that you have an additional `web` directory with a different name (like `web-de`), and that you configure your web server to route requests for that domain to the new web directory.


## Propagating Entries Across All Enabled Sites

In the settings for each Channel or Structure Section is an option to propagate entries in that section across all sites. When enabled, Craft will create the new entry in each site enabled for that section using the submitted content.

## Guide: Setting Up a New Site

In this short guide we'll walk through the steps of setting up a new site in Craft. This guide assumes you already have Craft installed and the default site setup and configured.

### Step 1: Create the Site in Settings

The first step is to create the new site in the Settings of your Craft installation.

1. Go to Settings -> Sites and click the New Site button.
2. Choose in which group your site should belong using the drop-down. The group selection won't have any impact on your site's functionality.
3. Give your site a name. Craft uses the site name in the Control Panel and you can also display it in your templates using `{{ siteName }}`.
4. Based on the Site name, Craft will generate a Site Handle. You can edit the Handle if you'd like. The Handle is how youâ€™ll refer to this site in the templates.
5. Choose the language for this site (see above for more information on how you can use languages).
6. If this site should be the Primary Site, toggle the Is Primary Site? to enable it.
7. Check the box for "This site has its own base URL" and then put in the Base URL. For our example it'll be `https://beta.craftcms.com`.
8. Save the new site.

### Step 2: Update the Site Sections and Fields

1. Go into each Section of the Craft installation and enable the new site.
2. Define the Entry URI Format, Template, and Status for the new site in each Section.
 
### Step 3: Define Translation Method of Fields

By default, your custom fields will store values on a per-site basis. If you have a Body field, each site can store its only content in that field. 

If your site has a different language than your default language then you will need to set each field as Translatable (by site, by language, or site group).

To set the Translation Method, go into each field you'd like to translate and choose the appropriate option under Translation Method.

### Step 4: Test Your Settings

Using new or existing entries, test that the Section, Field, and Translation Method settings work as you expect.

### Step 5: Creating a Web Directory

Now that we have our site created in the Craft Control Panel, we now need to make some changes to our files and directories to support the new site.

1. We need our web server to point to a web directory for this new site. Duplicate the existing `web` and name it something unique. In this example we'll use `web-beta`.
2. Edit the `index.php` file in the newly created `web-beta` directory (remember, we duplicated the existing `web` directory), adding this line near the top: `define('CRAFT_SITE', 'beta');` The name `beta` is the handle of the site we just created in the Control Panel.

This set up creates this directory structure:

```
web/                   --> craftcms.com/
    .htaccess
    index.php
web-beta/              --> beta.craftcms.com/
    .htaccess
    index.php
```

### Step 6: Check Your Asset Volumes Settings

If you have any local asset volumes, you will need to make sure those assets are available from each of your sites.

* The File System Path settings should be absolute (/full/path/to/example.com/images/).
* The URL settings should be absolute (http://example.com/images/) or protocol-relative (//example.com/images/).

### Step 7: Configure Your Web Server and DNS

1. Configure your web server so the domain (e.g. `beta.craftcms.com`) points at the new web directory.
2. Update your DNS records so the domain points at the web server.
