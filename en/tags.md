Tags
====

You can create folksonomies for your [entries]({entry:docs/sections-and-entries:url}), [users]({entry:docs/users:url}), and [assets]({entry:docs/assets:url}) using Tags.

## Tag Groups

Before you can create tags, you must create “tag groups” to contain them. Each tag group holds a unique set of tags, and lets you define a custom set of [fields]({entry:docs/fields}) that should be available to tags within the group.

To create a new tag group, go to Settings → Tags and click the “New Tag Group” button.

## Assigning Tags

To assign tags to things, you must also create a [Tags field]({entry:docs/tags-fields}). Each Tags field is connected to a single tag group. Whatever you attach the field to (entries, assets, users, etc.) will be able to create new tags and create [relations]({entry:docs/relations}) to any of the tags within that group.
